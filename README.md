# Terraform | AWS WAF | OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

## terraform-aws-waf-owasp

### IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS
1. The original source was taken from https://github.com/Twinuma/terraform-waf-owasp and was adapted to the needs of the project at hand.
We've also had https://registry.terraform.io/modules/juiceinc/juiceinc-waf as reference.

2. **SUB-MODULE SELECTION**
    * **Global WAF** for CloudFront usage
    * **Regional WAF** for Regional/ALB and/or API Gateway Stage usage

## Releases
- **Versions:** `<= 0.x.y` (Terraform 0.11.x compatible)
    - eg: https://registry.terraform.io/modules/binbashar/waf-owasp/aws/0.0.1

- **Versions:** `>= 1.x.y` (Terraform 0.12.x compatible)
    - eg: https://registry.terraform.io/modules/binbashar/waf-owasp/aws/1.0.0


## Use AWS WAF at terraform to Mitigate OWASPâ€™s Top 10 Web Application Vulnerabilities

OWASP Top 10 Most Critical Web Application Security Risks is a powerful awareness document for web
application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.
Project members include a variety of security experts from around the world who have shared their expertise to
produce this list[[1]](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project).
You can read the document that they published here: [[2]](https://www.owasp.org/images/7/72/OWASP_Top_10-2017_%28en%29.pdf.pdf).

This is a Terraform module which creates AWF WAF resources for protection of your resources from the OWASP Top 10
Security Risks. This module is based on the whitepaper that AWS provides. The whitepaper tells how to use AWS WAF
to mitigate those attacks[[3]](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/aws-waf-owasp.pdf)[[4]](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/07/use-aws-waf-to-mitigate-owasps-top-10-web-application-vulnerabilities/).

* AWS Blog - https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/07/use-aws-waf-to-mitigate-owasps-top-10-web-application-vulnerabilities/

### This module will create:
 1. match-sets[[5]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl-create-condition.html), to be associated with rules.
 2. rules[[6]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl-rules.html),
 3. WebACL[[7]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl-working-with.html), resources 1 and 2 cannot be used without 3.

**NOTE:** Diagram to be taken just as reference, needs update to reflect the exact deployed resources.
